# Python/Data-Engineer Assessment: RAG System with Vector Database

## Sender Info

from: Mahdi Rostami [<mahdi.rostami@specific-group.com>](mailto:mahdi.rostami@specific-group.com)


## Objective:
Develop a Retrieve-and-Generate (RAG) system that leverages a vector database to store and retrieve information. The system should expose an API built with FastAPI to answer questions based on the embedded data.
 
## Requirements:
 
### 1. Vector Database Integration:
- Implement a vector database (excluding ChromaDb) to store information in a structured format that allows for efficient similarity search.
- Justify the choice of the database considering factors such as performance, scalability, and community support.
 
### 2. Data Modeling:
- Design data models that effectively represent the information to be stored in the vector database.
- Explain the rationale behind the chosen schema and how it facilitates the RAG system's operations.
 
### 3. API Development:
- Use FastAPI to create endpoints that allow users to submit questions and receive answers.
- Ensure the API is well-documented and adheres to RESTful principles.
 
### 4. RAG System Logic:
- Develop the logic for the RAG system to retrieve relevant information from the vector database and generate answers.
- Incorporate state-of-the-art NLP techniques to enhance the quality of the generated responses.
 
## Deliverables:
 
1. **Source Code**: A repository containing the source code for the RAG system and API.
2. **API Documentation**: Swagger or Redoc documentation for the API endpoints.
 
## Evaluation Criteria:
 
- **Code Quality**: Clean, readable, and maintainable code with proper use of functions, classes, and modules.
- **System Design**: A well-architected system that is scalable and efficient.
- **Database Choice and Modeling**: Logical data models and a well-justified choice of vector database.
- **API Design**: RESTful API design with clear and consistent endpoints.
 
## Submission Instructions:
 
- Submit the source code and API documentation via a Git repository link.
- Ensure the repository is public or provide access to the reviewers.
 
 
## Notes for the Candidate:
 
- Focus on demonstrating your expertise in Python, data engineering, and API development.
- Show your ability to research and integrate new technologies effectively.
 
 
Good luck with your assessment!
